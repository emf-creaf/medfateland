</h2>
<p>The R package <strong>medfateland</strong> has been designed to
facilitate running simulations of forest functioning and dynamics at the
landscape to regional scales. The package allows executing the
stand-level models available in the R package <strong>medfate</strong>
on specific locations within a landscape, using either sequential or
parallel computation. Spatial units are uncoupled in those simulations,
where only local processes are represented. However,
<strong>medfateland</strong> provides additional functions that allow
performing model simulations while accounting for processes relating
different spatial units, such as lateral water transfer or seed
dispersal.</p>
<p>Complete documentation on the design and formulation of the
simulation models and their inputs can be found at the <a href="https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfatebook/index.html" class="external-link">medfate
reference book</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="data-structures">Data structures<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-structures"></a>
</h2>
<p>In previous versions of <strong>medfateland</strong> package, data
structures extended those of older version of
<strong>meteoland</strong>, which in turn depended by then on package
<strong>sp</strong>. Current versions of <strong>medfateland</strong>
(ver. &gt; 2.0.0) use package <strong>sf</strong> (simple features) to
represent spatial structures, both for inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>For simulations over an incomplete or complete grid, a column is
required in the <strong>sf</strong> object to specify neighborhood
between adjacent cells. Documentation of the variables that need to be
represented are given on the help pages of each simulation functions.
The package also includes point and grid data sets to run examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="local-and-landscape-processes">Local and landscape processes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#local-and-landscape-processes"></a>
</h2>
<p>The processes represented in simulations with
<strong>medfateland</strong> can be divided between <em>local</em> and
<em>landscape</em> processes. Examples of local water processes include
rainfall, canopy interception, infiltration and runoff, percolation and
deep drainage, soil evaporation and plant transpiration. Examples of
landscape processes would be lateral surface flows, sub-surface flows or
base flows. Seed dispersal is another example of landscape-level
process, because generates spatial dependency between spatial units.</p>
<p>Five kinds of land cover are recognized in
<strong>medfateland</strong>, which determine the set of local or
landscape processes that are represented:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>
<em>wildland</em>: forests, shrublands or grasslands.</li>
<li>
<em>agriculture</em>: agricultural lands.</li>
<li>
<em>rock</em>: rock outcrops.</li>
<li>
<em>artificial</em>: urban areas.</li>
<li>
<em>water</em>: water bodies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Local processes represented in <em>wildland</em> cells are those
described of <strong>medfate</strong> package. Lateral water transfer
processes and seed dispersal can be included in
<strong>medfateland</strong> simulations to add spatial dependencies.
Evapotranspiration and soil hydrology are also represented in
<em>agriculture</em> locations, although in a strongly simplified
manner, and lateral water transfer processes will also influence the
water balance in <em>agriculture</em> locations. The remaining land
covers are not the main focus of <strong>medfateland</strong>. They are
relevant to determine the water transfer between neighboring cells but
do not entail simulation of local processes.</p>

<h2 id="spatially-uncoupled-simulation-functions">Spatially uncoupled simulation functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatially-uncoupled-simulation-functions"></a>
</h2>
<p>Package <strong>medfateland</strong> allows performing simulations on
multiple locations in a single function call. In addition, those
simulations can be performed using <strong>parallel computing</strong>,
because of the absence of landscape-level processes that would induce
spatial dependency. Uncoupled simulation functions are detailed in the
following sub-sections and are illustrated the vignette <a href="https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/articles/SpatiallyUncoupledSimulations.html" class="external-link">Spatially-uncoupled
simulations</a>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="local-water-balance-functions">Local water balance functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#local-water-balance-functions"></a>
</h3>
<p>In package <strong>medfate</strong>, the local soil water balance of
a forest is primarily used to predict forest water flows and plant
drought stress; and the main simulation function is called
<code>spwb()</code>. Package <strong>medfateland</strong> extends the
former function by allowing the simulation of soil water balance for
multiple stands distributed spatially over a given time period using
function <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">spwb_spatial()</a></code>, which makes internal calls to
<code>spwb()</code> on elements the spatial classes introduced above.
Function <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial_day.html">spwb_spatial_day()</a></code> is analogous to the former, but
is used for the simulation of a single day, using internal calls to
function <code>spwb_day()</code> of <strong>medfate</strong>. Function
<code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">spwb_spatial()</a></code> and its one-day counterpart may be used
to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Monitor or forecast temporal variation in soil water content in
particular stands (for example to estimate mushroom yield) or over
continuous areas.</li>
<li>Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in
particular stands (for example to anticipate mortality events) or over
continuous areas.</li>
<li>Monitor or forecast temporal variation of fuel moisture in
particular stands (for example to monitor wildfire risk) or over
continuous areas.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="local-carbon-balance-and-plant-growth">Local carbon balance and plant growth<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#local-carbon-balance-and-plant-growth"></a>
</h3>
<p>Changes in leaf area, plant density and biomass are key to evaluate
the influence of climatic conditions on forest function and dynamics.
Processes affecting annual changes leaf area and plant size are those
involved water and carbon balances, as well as those affecting growth
directly. Processes influencing plant water balance include those
affecting soil water content, such as rainfall, canopy interception,
infiltration and runoff, percolation and deep drainage, soil evaporation
and plant transpiration. Carbon balance arises from the relationship
between plant photosynthesis and respiration, although carbon reserves
play a role in the availability of carbon for growth. Water and carbon
balances are coupled through the regulation of transpiration done by
stomata. Plant growth is affected by the availability of carbon (source
limitation), but also by temperature and water status (sink limitation).
Leaf area of plants can be severely decreased by drought stress, causing
an increase in dead leaf area and affecting carbon and water fluxes.</p>
<p>Package <strong>medfate</strong> allows simulating carbon balance,
growth and mortality of a set of plant cohorts (competing for light and
water) in a single forest stand using function <code>growth()</code>.
Package <strong>medfateland</strong> extends the former function by
providing function <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">growth_spatial()</a></code>, which operates on
spatial classes and makes internal calls to function
<code>growth()</code>. Function <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial_day.html">growth_spatial_day()</a></code> is
analogous to the former, but are used for the simulation of a single
day, using internal calls to function <code>growth_day()</code> of
<strong>medfate</strong>. Function <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">growth_spatial()</a></code> and its
one-day counterpart may be used to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Monitor or forecast temporal variation in water fluxes and soil
water content in particular stands (for example to estimate regulation
ecosystem services) taking into account processes determining plant
growth.</li>
<li>Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in
particular stands(for example to anticipate mortality events) taking
into account processes determining plant growth.</li>
<li>Monitor or forecast temporal variation of live fuel moisture and the
amount of standing dead and live fuels in particular stands (for example
to monitor wildfire risk).</li>
</ol>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="local-forest-dynamics">Local forest dynamics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#local-forest-dynamics"></a>
</h3>
<p>Changes in forest structure and composition result from the interplay
of natural demographic processes (growth, mortality and recruitment) and
natural or anthropogenic disturbances, including the effects of forest
management.</p>
<p>Package <strong>medfate</strong> includes function
<code>fordyn()</code>, which allows simulating these processes at yearly
time steps on a given forest stand, building on previous models. Package
<strong>medfateland</strong> extends the former function by providing
function <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">fordyn_spatial()</a></code>, which operates on spatial
classes and make internal calls to function <code>fordyn()</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="spatial-coordination-via-management-scenarios">Spatial coordination via management scenarios<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-coordination-via-management-scenarios"></a>
</h2>
<p>In addition to the former spatially-uncoupled simulation functions,
<strong>medfateland</strong> provides function
<code><a href="../reference/fordyn_scenario.html">fordyn_scenario()</a></code> for landscape to regional-scale
simulations. This function allows performing simulations of forest
function and dynamics for a set of forest stands, while coordinating
management actions in the set of stands following a timber demand-based
approach, which defines the amount of wood to be cut annually for target
tree species. In addition, stands are classified into management units,
which can be associated with different silvicultural practices.
Management decisions are evaluated once a year, which means that the
simulation of processes occurring within a year are spatially uncoupled.
For this reason, <code><a href="../reference/fordyn_scenario.html">fordyn_scenario()</a></code> makes internal calls to
<code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">fordyn_spatial()</a></code> every year, where local simulations are in
parallel. These kind of simulations are illustrated in vignette <a href="https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/articles/ManagementScenario.html" class="external-link">Management
scenario</a>.</p>

<h2 id="watershed-simulations-including-spatial-processes">Watershed simulations including spatial processes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#watershed-simulations-including-spatial-processes"></a>
</h2>
<p>When input data is in form of continuous spatial variation of forests
over a landscape, the <strong>medfateland</strong> package allows
performing local process simulations while accounting for landscape
processes. This is done using functions <code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">spwb_land()</a></code>,
<code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">growth_land()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">fordyn_land()</a></code>, which are
analogous to <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">spwb_spatial()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">growth_spatial()</a></code>
and <code><a href="../reference/spwb_spatial.html">fordyn_spatial()</a></code>, respectively.</p>
<p>Importantly, the three functions allow simulating lateral water
transfer processes. Here, two sub-models are possible, of different
complexity. A first sub-model, similar to TETIS (FrancÃ©s et al.Â 2007) is
offered by default, which includes three lateral water flows that are
solved in a rather crude way:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Overland surface flows from upslope cells</li>
<li>Lateral saturated soil flows (i.e.Â interflow) between adjacent
cells</li>
<li>Lateral groundwater flow (i.e.Â baseflow) between adjacent cells</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, distributed hydrological simulations can done via a
coupling with SERGHEI (Caviedes-VoulliÃ¨me et al.Â 2023). This sub-model
allows simulating the same processes but in a much greater physical
detail. In that case, SERGHEI outputs are generated as files and are not
provided with the output to the function call. Hence, the user is
responsible for accessing and post-processing those outputs.</p>
<p>Functions <code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">spwb_land()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">growth_land()</a></code> may
be used to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Determine areas where particular plant species have high
vulnerability to suffer from drought stress or fire risk, while
accounting for watershed hydrology.</li>
<li>Partition the total rainfall in given watershed among:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>water evaporated from canopy interception or bare soil
evaporation</li>
<li>water transpired by plants</li>
<li>water exported via runoff or deep drainage into the water table and
river streams.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Function <code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">fordyn_land()</a></code> includes seed dispersal as an
additional landscape process. Similarly to the relationship between
<code>fordyn()</code> and <code>growth()</code>,
<code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">fordyn_land()</a></code> makes a call, once a year, to
<code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">growth_land()</a></code>, which deals with all daily processes. After
that, dispersal, regeneration and forest management are simulated at the
level of <code><a href="../reference/spwb_land.html">fordyn_land()</a></code>. This function may be used to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Determine the effect of forest management alternatives on the forest
function, dynamics and the water production of forested watersheds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of watershed simulations including landscape processes are
given in vignette <a href="https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/articles/WatershedSimulations.html" class="external-link">Watershed
simulations</a>.</p>
