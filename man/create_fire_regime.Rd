\title{Create fire regime}
\usage{
create_fire_regime(annual_burned_area, sd_burned_area = NULL, doy = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{annual_burned_area}{A named vector of burned area in hectares for simulation years.}

\item{sd_burned_area}{A named vector of standard deviation (in log scale) of burned area. If specified, annual target to burn will be determined
using a log-normal distribution with mean values given by \code{annual_burned_area}.}

\item{doy}{A named integer vector with the day of the year (i.e. between 1 and 366) when fires will be simulated for each simulation year in \code{annual_burned_area}. If NULL
fires will be simulated on the driest day (i.e. when vapor pressure deficit is largest).}
}
\value{
A list with the supplied parameters
}
\description{
Defines an object containing fire regime parameters for simulations of forest dynamics.
}
\details{
Names of \code{annual_burned_area} should be simulation years. If provided, \code{sd_burned_area} should be a vector of the same size as
\code{annual_burned_area} and have the same names.
}
\examples{
# Fire regime with pre-defined burned area values
reg1 <- create_fire_regime(annual_burned_area = c("2002" = 1000, "2003" = 5000)) 

# Fire regime with log-normal distribution for burned area
reg2 <- create_fire_regime(annual_burned_area = c("2002" = 1000, "2003" = 5000),
                           sd_burned_area = c("2002" = 0.9, "2003" = 0.8))
