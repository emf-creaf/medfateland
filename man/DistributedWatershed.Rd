\title{Defines a distributed watershed}
\usage{
DistributedWatershed(
  spxt,
  lct,
  forestlist,
  soillist,
  bedrock,
  channel,
  validateOutlets = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spxt}{An object of class \code{\link{SpatialPixelsTopography}}.}

\item{lct}{A character vector with the land cover type of each grid cell (values should be 'wildland', 'agriculture', 'rock', 'artificial' or 'water').}

\item{forestlist}{A list of objects of class 'forest' with the same number of elements as spatial pixels.}

\item{soillist}{A list of objects of class 'forest' with the same number of elements as spatial pixels.}

\item{bedrock}{A data frame with the same number of rows as spatial pixels and containing hydraulic bedrock properties: 'DepthToBedrock' (mm), 'Conductivity' (m/day), 'Porosity' ([0-1]).}

\item{channel}{A logical vector to indicate which watershed cells belong to the channel network.}

\item{validateOutlets}{A flag to remove outlet cells that are outside channel network and on the boundaries of the watershed.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{DistributedWatershed-class}}.
