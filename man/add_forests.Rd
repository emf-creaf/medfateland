add_forests(
  x,
  tree_table = NULL,
  tree_mapping = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link[sf]{sf}} with a valid CRS definition, and a column called 'id'.}

\item{tree_table}{A data frame with tree records in rows and attributes in columns. Tree records can correspond to individual trees or groups of trees with an associated density.}

\item{tree_mapping}{A named character vector to specify mappings of columns in \code{tree_table} into attributes of \code{treeData}. Accepted names (and the corresponding specifications for the columns in \code{tree_table}) are:
\itemize{
\item{"id": Forest stand id.}
\item{"Species": Species code (should follow codes in \code{SpParams}).}
\item{"Species.name": Species name. In this case, the species code will be drawn by matching names with species names in \code{SpParams}.}
\item{"N": Tree density (in ind./ha).}
\item{"DBH": Diameter at breast height (in cm).}
\item{"Height": Tree height (in cm).}
\item{"plot.size": Plot size (in m2) to which each record refers to. This is used to calculate tree density (stems per hectare) when not supplied.}
\item{"Z50": Depth (in mm) corresponding to 50 percent of fine roots.}
\item{"Z95": Depth (in mm) corresponding to 95 percent of fine roots.}
}}

\item{shrub_table}{A data frame with shrub records in rows and attributes in columns. Records can correspond to individual shrubs (with crown dimensions and height) or groups of shrubs with an associated cover estimate.}

\item{shrub_mapping}{A named character vector to specify mappings of columns in \code{shrub_table} into attributes of \code{shrubData}. Accepted names (and the corresponding specifications for the columns in \code{shrub_table}) are:
\itemize{
\item{"id": Forest stand id.}
\item{"Species": Species code (should follow codes in \code{SpParams}).}
\item{"Species.name": Species name. In this case, the species code will be drawn by matching names with species names in \code{SpParams}.}
\item{"Cover": Shrub cover (in percent).}
\item{"D1": Shrub largest crown diameter (in cm).}
\item{"D2": Shrub crown diameter orthogonal to the largest one (in cm).}
\item{"Height": Shrub height (in cm).}
\item{"plot.size": Plot size (in m2) to which each record refers to. This is used to calculate shrub cover when shrub data is given at the individual level.}
\item{"Z50": Depth (in mm) corresponding to 50 percent of fine roots.}
\item{"Z95": Depth (in mm) corresponding to 95 percent of fine roots.}
}}

\item{merge_trees}{A logical flag to simplify tree cohorts by merging tree records in DBH classes (see \code{\link[medfate]{forest_mergeTrees}}).}

\item{merge_shrubs}{A logical flag to simplify shrub cohorts by merging shrub records in height classes (see \code{\link[medfate]{forest_mergeShrubs}}).}

\item{SpParams}{A data frame with species parameters (see \code{\link[medfate]{SpParamsMED}}) from which valid species names are drawn.}

\item{progress}{A logical flag to include a progress bar while processing the data.}
}
\value{
A modified object of class \code{\link[sf]{sf}} with column 'forest'.
}
\description{
Creates and adds forest data to an \code{\link[sf]{sf}} object by reading from tree and shrub data tables
}
\details{
The current implementation will replace existing forests of the indicated 'id' values.
