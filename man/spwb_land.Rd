\description{
Function \code{spwb_land} implements a distributed hydrological model that simulates daily local water balance, from \code{\link{spwb_day}},
on grid cells of a watershed while accounting for overland runoff, subsurface flow and groundwater flow between cells.
Function \code{growth_land} is similar, but includes daily local carbon balance and growth processes in grid cells,
provided by \code{\link{growth_day}}.
}
\details{
Functions \code{spwb_land} and \code{growth_land} require daily meteorological data over grid cells.
The user may supply four different inputs:

\enumerate{
\item{A data frame with meteorological data common for all spatial location (spatial variation of weather not considered).}
\item{An object of class \code{\link{stars}} with interpolation data, created by package meteoland.}
\item{DEPRECATED: An object of \code{\link{SpatialPixelsMeteorology-class}} or \code{\link{SpatialGridMeteorology-class}}.
All the spatio-temporal variation of weather is already supplied by the user.}
\item{DEPRECATED: An object of \code{\link{MeteorologyInterpolationData-class}}. Interpolation of weather is performed over each spatial unit every simulated day.}
}
