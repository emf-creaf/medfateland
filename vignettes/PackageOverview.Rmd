## Introduction

The R package **medfateland** (v. `r packageVersion("medfateland")`) has been designed to facilitate running simulations of forest functioning and dynamics at the landscape to regional scales. The package allows executing the stand-level models available in the R package **medfate** on specific locations within a landscape, using either sequential or parallel computation. Spatial units are uncoupled in those simulations, where only local processes are represented. However, **medfateland** provides additional functions that allow performing model simulations while accounting for processes relating different spatial units, such as lateral water transfer or seed dispersal. 

Complete documentation on the design and formulation of the simulation models and their inputs can be found at the [medfate reference book](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfatebook/index.html). 

## Data structures

In previous versions of **medfateland** package, data structures extended those of older version of **meteoland**, which in turn depended by then on package **sp**. Current versions of **medfateland** (ver. > 2.0.0) use package **sf** (simple features) to represent spatial structures, both for inputs and outputs. 

For simulations over an incomplete or complete grid, an additional input, in form of a raster topology (from package **terra**), is required to specify the neighborhood between adjacent cells and cell size. Both spatial inputs need to be compatible. 

## Local and landscape processes

The processes represented in simulations with **medfateland** can be divided between *local* and *landscape* processes. Examples of local water processes include rainfall, canopy interception, infiltration and runoff, percolation and deep drainage, soil evaporation and plant transpiration. Examples of landscape processes would be lateral surface flows, sub-surface flows or base flows. Seed dispersal is another example of landscape-level process, because generates spatial dependency between spatial units.

Five kinds of land cover are recognized in **medfateland**, which determine the set of local or landscape processes that are represented:

  a. *wildland*: forests, shrublands or grasslands.
  b. *agriculture*: agricultural lands.
  c. *rock*: rock outcrops.
  d. *artificial*: urban areas.
  e. *water*: water bodies. 

Local processes represented in *wildland* cells are those described of **medfate** package. Lateral water transfer processes and seed dispersal can be included in **medfateland** simulations to add spatial dependencies. Evapotranspiration and soil hydrology are also represented in *agriculture* locations, although in a strongly simplified manner, and lateral water transfer processes will also influence the water balance in *agriculture* locations. The remaining land covers are not the main focus of **medfateland**. They are relevant to determine the water transfer between neighboring cells but do not entail simulation of local processes.

## Spatially-uncoupled simulation functions

Package **medfateland** allows performing simulations on multiple locations in a single function call. In addition, those simulations can be performed using **parallel computing**, because of the absence of landscape-level processes that would induce spatial dependency. Uncoupled simulation functions are detailed in the following sub-sections and are illustrated the vignette [Spatially-uncoupled simulations](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/articles/SpatiallyUncoupledSimulations.html).

### Local water balance functions

In package **medfate**, the local soil water balance of a forest is primarily used to predict forest water flows and plant drought stress; and the main simulation function is called `spwb()`. Package **medfateland**  extends the former function by allowing the simulation of soil water balance for multiple stands distributed spatially over a given time period using function `spwb_spatial()`, which makes internal calls to `spwb()` on elements the spatial classes introduced above. Function `spwb_spatial_day()` is analogous to the former, but is used for the simulation of a single day, using internal calls to function `spwb_day()` of **medfate**. Function `spwb_spatial()` and its one-day counterpart may be used to:

1. Monitor or forecast temporal variation in soil water content in particular stands (for example to estimate mushroom yield) or over continuous areas.
2. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in particular stands (for example to anticipate mortality events) or over continuous areas.
3. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of fuel moisture in particular stands (for example to monitor wildfire risk) or over continuous areas.


### Local carbon balance and plant growth

Changes in leaf area, plant density and biomass are key to evaluate the influence of climatic conditions on forest function and dynamics. Processes affecting annual changes leaf area and plant size are those involved water and carbon balances, as well as those affecting growth directly. Processes influencing plant water balance include those affecting soil water content, such as rainfall, canopy interception, infiltration and runoff, percolation and deep drainage, soil evaporation and plant transpiration. Carbon balance arises from the relationship between plant photosynthesis and respiration, although carbon reserves play a role in the availability of carbon for growth. Water and carbon balances are coupled through the regulation of transpiration done by stomata. Plant growth is affected by the availability of carbon (source limitation), but also by temperature and water status (sink limitation). Leaf area of plants can be severely decreased by drought stress, causing an increase in dead leaf area and affecting carbon and water fluxes. 

Package **medfate** allows simulating carbon balance, growth and mortality of a set of plant cohorts (competing for light and water) in a single forest stand using function `growth()`. Package **medfateland** extends the former function by providing function `growth_spatial()`, which operates on spatial classes and makes internal calls to function `growth()`. Function `growth_spatial_day()` is analogous to the former, but are used for the simulation of a single day, using internal calls to function `growth_day()` of **medfate**. Function `growth_spatial()` and its one-day counterpart may be used to:

1. Monitor or forecast temporal variation in water fluxes and soil water content in particular stands (for example to estimate regulation ecosystem services) taking into account processes determining plant growth.
2. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in particular stands(for example to anticipate mortality events) taking into account processes determining plant growth.
3. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of live fuel moisture and the amount of standing dead and live fuels in particular stands (for example to monitor wildfire risk).


### Local forest dynamics 

Changes in forest structure and composition result from the interplay of natural demographic processes (growth, mortality and recruitment) and natural or anthropogenic disturbances, including the effects of forest management. 

Package **medfate** includes function `fordyn()`, which allows simulating these processes at yearly time steps on a given forest stand, building on previous models. Package **medfateland** extends the former function by providing function `fordyn_spatial()`, which operates on spatial classes and make internal calls to function `fordyn()`. 

## Spatial coordination via management scenarios

In addition to the former spatially-uncoupled simulation functions, **medfateland** provides function `fordyn_scenario()` for landscape to regional-scale simulations. This function allows performing simulations of forest function and dynamics for a set of forest stands, while coordinating management actions in the set of stands following a timber demand-based approach, which defines the amount of wood to be cut annually for target tree species. In addition, stands are classified into management units, which can be associated with different silvicultural practices. Management decisions are evaluated once a year, which means that the simulation of processes occurring within a year are spatially uncoupled. For this reason, `fordyn_scenario()` makes internal calls to `fordyn_spatial()` every year, where local simulations are in parallel. These kind of simulations are illustrated in vignette [Management scenarios](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/articles/ManagementScenarios.html).

## Watershed simulations including spatial processes

When input data is in form of continuous spatial variation of forests over a landscape, the **medfateland** package allows performing local process simulations while accounting for landscape processes. This is done using functions `spwb_land()`, `growth_land()` and `fordyn_land()`, which are analogous to `spwb_spatial()`, `growth_spatial()` and `fordyn_spatial()`, respectively. 

Importantly, the three functions allow simulating lateral water transfer processes. Here, two sub-models are possible, of different complexity. A first sub-model, similar to TETIS (Franc√©s et al. 2007) is offered by default, which includes three lateral water flows that are solved in a rather crude way:

  a. Overland surface flows from upslope cells
  b. Lateral saturated soil flows (i.e. interflow) between adjacent cells
  c. Lateral groundwater flow (i.e. baseflow) between adjacent cells

Alternatively, distributed hydrological simulations can done via a coupling with SERGHEI (Caviedes-Voulli√®me et al. 2023). This sub-model allows simulating the same processes but in a much greater physical detail. In that case, SERGHEI outputs are generated as files and are not provided with the output to the function call. Hence, the user is responsible for accessing and post-processing those outputs.

Functions `spwb_land()` and `growth_land()` may be used to:

1. Determine areas where particular plant species have high vulnerability to suffer from drought stress or fire risk, while accounting for watershed hydrology.
2. Partition the total rainfall in given watershed among: 
   i) water evaporated from canopy interception or bare soil evaporation
   ii) water transpired by plants
   iii) water exported via runoff or deep drainage into the water table and river streams.

Function `fordyn_land()` includes seed dispersal as an additional landscape process. Similarly to the relationship between `fordyn()` and `growth()`, `fordyn_land()` makes a call, once a year, to `growth_land()`, which deals with all daily processes. After that, dispersal, regeneration and forest management are simulated at the level of `fordyn_land()`. This function may be used to:

1. Determine the effect of forest management alternatives on the forest function, dynamics and the water production of forested watersheds.

Examples of watershed simulations including landscape processes are given in vignette [Watershed simulations](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/articles/WatershedSimulations.html).
