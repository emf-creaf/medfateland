## Introduction

The R package **medfateland** has been designed to extend the capabilities of package **medfate** to the landscape level. It allows running the stand-level models available in medfate on points and cells within landscape, including the possibility of parallelization. Additionally, medfateland allows considering spatial hydrological processes in forested watersheds. Hence, medfateland can be used as a tool for eco-hydrological applications.   


## Package installation

Since both packages evolve together, installing **medfateland** normally requires an up-to-date version of **medfate**. 

The package is not available from CRAN because it is still under active development. Beta versions of package **medfateland** can be installed from GitHub as follows:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfateland")
```


## Documentation

A number of *vignettes* illustrate how to run simulation models in **medfateland**. These can be found at the package [website](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/).

The user is also advised to read articles included in the [website](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/) of package **medfate**.

A complete documentation of both packages, including a *reference book*, can be found at https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfatebook/index.html. 

## Authorship

The set of R packages are developed and maintained by the [*Ecosystem Modelling Facility*](https://emf.creaf.cat) unit at [*CREAF*](https://www.creaf.cat/) (in Spain), in close collaboration with researchers from [*URFM-INRAE*](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/ecologie_des_forets_mediterraneennes/) (in France) and [*CTFC*](https://www.ctfc.cat/) (in Spain).
