## Introduction

The R package **medfateland** has been designed to extend the capabilities of package **medfate** in a spatially-explicit context. It allows running the stand-level models available in medfate on points and cells within landscape or region, including the possibility of parallelization. Additionally, medfateland allows considering seed dispersal and lateral water transfer processes in forested watersheds. Hence, medfateland can be used as a tool for eco-hydrological applications.   


## Package installation

Since both packages evolve together, installing **medfateland** normally requires an up-to-date version of **medfate**. 

The package is not available from CRAN because it is still under active development. Beta versions of package **medfateland** can be installed from GitHub as follows:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfateland")
```


## Documentation

A number of *vignettes* illustrate how to initialize inputs and run simulation models in **medfateland**. These can be found at the package [website](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland/).

The user is also advised to read articles included in the [website](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/) of package **medfate**.

A complete documentation of both packages, including a *reference book*, can be found at https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfatebook/index.html. 

## Companion R packages

The modelling tools included in **medfate** and **medfateland** are complemented with two companion packages:

  + Package [**meteoland**](https://emf-creaf.github.io/meteoland) allows generating daily weather input for simulation models in **medfate** and **medfateland**.
  + Package [**traits4models**](https://emf-creaf.github.io/traits4models) provides functions to help creating species parameter inputs for process-based models such as those in for **medfate** and **medfateland** functions  [*under development*].

The relationships between the four packages are illustrated in the figure below, where black arrows indicate package dependencies and gray arrows indicate model parameter provision.

## Authorship

The set of R packages are developed and maintained by the [*Ecosystem Modelling Facility*](https://emf.creaf.cat) unit at [*CREAF*](https://www.creaf.cat/) (in Spain), in close collaboration with researchers from [*URFM-INRAE*](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/ecologie_des_forets_mediterraneennes/) (in France) and [*CTFC*](https://www.ctfc.cat/) (in Spain).
